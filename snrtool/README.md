# SNR tool

This tool comes from the snrtool respository found at: [jonwil/snrtool](https://github.com/jonwil/snrtool)

Only the binaries are present here as the backend code is under the copyright of Electronic Arts.

## Usage

You can use this tool to generate EA Layer 3 samples from .wav files.

Simply pass the input file as an argument and the tool will output the .snr and .sns files in the same location.
